Read data from the file specified by fd.

buffer is the buffer that the data will be written to.

offset is the offset in the buffer to start writing at.

length is an integer specifying the number of bytes to read.

position is an argument specifying where to begin reading from in the file. If position is null, data will be read from the current file position, and the file position will be updated. If position is an integer, the file position will remain unchanged.

The callback is given the three arguments, (err, bytesRead, buffer).
